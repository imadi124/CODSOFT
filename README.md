## 📂 Projects Overview

### 1. 🌸 Iris Flower Classification
**Description:** A classification project that identifies Iris flower species (*Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica*) based on sepal and petal dimensions. This fundamental machine learning project demonstrates the basics of supervised learning and multi-class classification.

**Model Prediction:** The trained model predicts the correct Iris species based on input flower measurements with an accuracy of ~97–100%.

### 2. 💰 Sales Prediction
**Description:** A regression-based project that forecasts future sales based on factors like advertising expenditure, target audience, and marketing strategy. This project helps businesses make data-driven decisions for optimizing marketing budgets and planning inventory.

**Model Prediction:** The regression model estimates future sales values based on new input data such as advertising costs and marketing efforts with high accuracy.

### 3. 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction
**Description:** A binary classification project that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, gender, passenger class, and fare. This classic data science project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification techniques.

**Model Prediction:** The model predicts passenger survival status with an accuracy of approximately 80–85% based on historical Titanic data.
