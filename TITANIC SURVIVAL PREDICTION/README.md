### What I Did
- Loaded and explored the Titanic dataset.  
- Handled missing values and encoded categorical data.  
- Visualized correlations between survival rate and passenger attributes.  
- Built a machine learning model using classification algorithms.  
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

### Tech Stack Used
- **Python**  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**  
- **Scikit-learn**

---

### Final Output & Prediction
- The trained model predicts whether a passenger survived or not based on input features.  
- Achieved an accuracy of **around 80–85%** on the test dataset.
